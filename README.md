# Research and Findings around Chroma from Luma (CfL)

## What is this?
This is a collection of exploratory jupyter notebooks about Chroma from Luma
prediction.


## Why?
As work progressed on CfL, I started creating jupyter notebooks here and there,
and quickly lost control of all the different versions. This project aims to
collect and organize research and findings related to CfL.

This work is inspired by:
